### 🧠 About me

I'm a web developer with **15+ years of experience** building web applications.  
Over the last years, I've specialized in **Ruby on Rails**, working on fullstack projects with **Angular** on the frontend.  
I’m passionate about clean code, **TDD**, automation, and **CI/CD** pipelines.

🇨🇺 Originally from Cuba, now living in Germany 🇩🇪.  
📚 Lifelong learner, currently diving into Kubernetes, ViewComponents, and AnyCable.

I bring a strong sense of discipline, loyalty, responsibility, and commitment to every team I join. I strive to contribute with critical thinking while also respecting and supporting the final decisions of project leaders. I believe in long‑term collaboration and being fully accountable for both the code I write and the goals we aim to achieve as a team.
